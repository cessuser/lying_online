      In module 3 you will see a picture puzzle for {{ Constants.word_puzzle_seconds }} seconds. Your task is to identify the number of cows in the picture. Once the {{ Constants.word_puzzle_seconds }} seconds pass, the picture will disappear. After the {{ Constants.word_puzzle_seconds }} seconds you should indicate how many cows you managed to find. You will not have to say which, but only how many you found. You will get $0.25 for every cow you find. Press the button to start.
